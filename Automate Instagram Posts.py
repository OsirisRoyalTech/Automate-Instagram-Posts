# Here’s an example of how you can automate Instagram posts using the instabot library:

"""
1. Install Instabot:
First, you need to install the instabot package, which simplifies the process of automating
Instagram actions.
"""

import instabot

#pip install instabot

"""
2. Python Script to Automate Posting:
Here’s a basic Python script that will log into Instagram and post an image with a caption:
"""

from instabot import Bot

# Initialize the bot
bot = Bot()

# Login to Instagram
bot.login(username="your_username", password="your_password")

# Upload an image with a caption
image_path = "path_to_your_image.jpg"  # Image to upload
caption = "This is an automated post #hashtag"

bot.upload_photo(image_path, caption=caption)

"""
3. Explanation:
•	Bot login: You need to provide your Instagram username and password to log into the account.
•	Upload Photo: upload_photo is the method used to upload the photo from the specified path with the given caption.
4. Automating Posts with Scheduling:
If you want to schedule the posts at a specific time, you can combine this with Python’s schedule or 
APScheduler library to execute posts at predefined intervals.
"""

# Example using schedule:
# pip install schedule
import schedule
import time
from instabot import Bot

# Function to post image
def post_image():
    bot = Bot()
    bot.login(username="your_username", password="your_password")
    image_path = "path_to_your_image.jpg"
    caption = "Scheduled automated post!"
    bot.upload_photo(image_path, caption=caption)

# Schedule the post to run every day at 9:00 AM
schedule.every().day.at("09:00").do(post_image)

# Keep running the schedule
while True:
    schedule.run_pending()
    time.sleep(60)  # Wait for a minute before checking again
# This will automatically post the image every day at 9:00 AM.
